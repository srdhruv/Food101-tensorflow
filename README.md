# Food101-tensorflow
* In thes project, a deep neural network was trained for classifying 101 different food types, the dataset used was food101.
* EffiecientNetB7 was used as a base model, which was fine tuned to get acheive higher accuracy.
* Mixed precision was used to reduce computatioin time.
* After four hours of training 82.97 percent of accuracy was achieved on the validation data.
## Output Screenshots:
